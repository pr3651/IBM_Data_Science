# Machine_Learning_with_Python
Using Classification Algorithms to build an accurate model using the given training set and reporting the accuracy of the model using the given test set.
We used the following algorithm:
- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression
